# Object Oriented Javascript
- Javascript Under the hood
- EcmaScript5 (JS v 5)
- ES6 (JS version 6)

# Object Oriented
- style of program where data is based on "objects"
   - "group together similar data and similar behavior"
   fido = Dog.new("Fido")
   sparky = Dog.new("Sparky")
   fido.name  => data
   sparky.name => data
   fido.bark => behavior
   sparky.bark => behavior


## Object Creation Patterns
- literal {}
- Factory pattern
- `new` Object

## `new` and constructor calls
- properties (data)
- methods (behavior)

## Prototype Chain, and `__proto__`
- .__proto__ property of an object, points to that object's parent's prototype object

## Parts of a Class
- Attributes (instance variables)
- Methods (call some function associated with the object)
  - Instance methods - behavior of one of these kinds of objects
  - Class methods - behavior associated with the whole class

## Object inheritance and Object relationships
- class Teacher extends Person

## Annoucement: Register/come to Final Projects tonight
