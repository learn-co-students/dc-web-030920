# Event Listeners
## Type of Events
- submit
- click
- keyboard events (keypress)
- mouseover
- DOMContentLoaded


//When some event happens => DOM changes
 // a new row for shannon the table
 // clear the form


## .addEventListener() on a DOM node
- takes in a string for the type of the event, and a callback function to be invoked when the event happens
- (optional) argument for the callback is the event itself


## Practice
- When submit the form -> add new instructor row
- When click of email -> alert("contacting <email> ")


## When to add an event Listener
- on load of page?
- on creation of element?



## Some events have default behavior
- event.preventDefault()


//DOM
//Events
//Server Communication (saving to the Database)
