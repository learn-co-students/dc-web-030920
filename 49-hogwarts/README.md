# Hogwarts Review:
- Less on Props, State, and Events
- More on how to approach app building

## Project goals:

X create an index displaying all hog tiles, render each hog name and picture in a tile
X show the hog's details upon a user's click
X filter the hogs that are greased
* sort the hogs based on name
* sort the hogs based on weight

* BONUS: allow users to hide hogs (not delete them, just hide them from view!)
* BONUS: bring in pig gifs from an API
* BONUS: implement [Semantic Cards](https://semantic-ui.com/views/card.html) for each hog


## Approach
- Wireframe and Plan out your component Hierarchy!
- Build out Feature By Feature
- When some event happens => I want to change state, and that will re-render the DOM

## React is overwhelming! Where should I be?
- Props vs State
- Events and this.setState()
- Forms
- Lifecycle methods and Async React (fetching)

- AKA the first 48 Scrimba lessons

## How do I know I'm getting it?
- Combining It All
- Hogwarts
- Async React > Async React Mini Project (fetching and lifecycle methods)
- Advanced Components > Container Components Lab: Movie Reviews
