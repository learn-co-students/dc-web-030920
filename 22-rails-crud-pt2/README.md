* Objectives
    - Build a Rails RESTful app with full CRUD capabilities
    - Distinguish between `form_for` and `form_tag`, and use both helpers
        - form_for: fields on the form correspond to columns on database model
        - form_tag: generic form
    - Use Rails link helpers to build links
    - Use `rails routes` to abstract URLs
    - Use "before" actions to minimize repeated code
